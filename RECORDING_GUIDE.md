# Video Recording Implementation Guide

## Overview

This app now implements **real video recording** functionality that starts when a video begins playing and stops when the video ends. The recording captures the user's reactions using the device's front camera and microphone.

## How It Works

### 1. Recording Flow
- **User presses play button** â†’ Video starts playing + Recording begins automatically
- **Video plays** â†’ Recording continues in real-time
- **Video ends** â†’ Recording stops automatically
- **Result** â†’ User's reaction video is saved to device storage

### 2. Technical Implementation
- Uses `react-native-camera` for real camera access
- Records in 720p quality with H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec
- Automatically adjusts bitrates based on platform (Android/iOS)
- Includes error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 3. Permissions Required
- **Camera**: To record video reactions
- **Microphone**: To record audio during reactions
- **Storage**: To save recorded videos

## Testing the Recording

### 1. Basic Test
1. Open the app and navigate to a video
2. Grant camera and microphone permissions when prompted
3. Press the play button (â–¶)
4. The video will start playing and recording will begin automatically
5. Watch the video (your reactions will be recorded)
6. When the video ends, recording stops automatically
7. You'll see a confirmation that your reaction video was saved

### 2. Advanced Testing (Test Button)
- Look for the ðŸ§ª button in the top-right corner
- This button appears when camera is ready and video is not playing
- Tap it to run a 3-second recording test
- Useful for debugging recording issues

### 3. Console Logs
Check the console for detailed information:
- Camera initialization status
- Recording start/stop events
- Recording options and settings
- Any errors or warnings

## Recording Quality Settings

### Default Settings
- **Video Quality**: 720p
- **Video Bitrate**: 2-3 Mbps (platform dependent)
- **Audio Bitrate**: 128 kbps
- **Audio Channels**: 1 (mono)
- **Max File Size**: 100 MB
- **Max Duration**: Video duration or 5 minutes

### Platform Optimizations
- **Android**: Higher bitrates for better quality
- **iOS**: Optimized bitrates for stability

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Camera Permission Denied
- **Symptom**: "Camera permission required" message
- **Solution**: Go to device Settings > Apps > VideoPermissionsApp > Permissions and grant camera access

#### 2. Recording Fails to Start
- **Symptom**: "Failed to start recording" error
- **Solution**: 
  - Check if camera is ready (should show "ðŸ“¹ Ready" in camera preview)
  - Restart the app
  - Ensure device has sufficient storage space

#### 3. Poor Recording Quality
- **Symptom**: Low quality or choppy recordings
- **Solution**: 
  - Check device performance
  - Ensure good lighting conditions
  - Close other apps to free up resources

#### 4. Audio Not Recording
- **Symptom**: Video records but no audio
- **Solution**: 
  - Grant microphone permission
  - Check device microphone settings
  - Ensure microphone is not muted

### Debug Information

The app provides several debugging features:

1. **Camera Status Display**: Shows current camera state in the PiP preview
2. **Console Logging**: Detailed logs for all recording operations
3. **Test Button**: Manual recording test for debugging
4. **Error Alerts**: User-friendly error messages

## File Storage

### Recording Location
- **Android**: Internal app storage or external storage (based on permissions)
- **iOS**: App's documents directory

### File Format
- **Container**: MP4
- **Video Codec**: H.264
- **Audio Codec**: AAC
- **Resolution**: 720p (1280x720)

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
- Recording buffer: ~50-100 MB
- Final file size: Depends on video duration and quality

### Battery Impact
- Camera recording is battery-intensive
- Recommend charging device during long recording sessions

### Storage Requirements
- Ensure at least 200 MB free space for recording
- Videos are automatically compressed to save space

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Custom recording quality settings
- Recording preview before saving
- Multiple recording formats
- Cloud storage integration
- Social media sharing

### Customization Options
- Adjustable video quality
- Custom recording duration limits
- Background recording support
- Multiple camera support

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the console logs for error details
2. Use the test button to isolate recording problems
3. Verify all permissions are granted
4. Restart the app and try again
5. Check device compatibility and storage space
